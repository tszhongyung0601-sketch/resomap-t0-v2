/**
 * The drawer of the app.
 *
 * Everything low-frequency lives here — the ledger, the documents, the
 * settings, the business demo — which is what lets the other four tabs each
 * stay a single task. Most rows are honest T0 placeholders: they are listed
 * because the shape of the product includes them, and they do nothing yet.
 *
 * A row carries a value only when that value is computed from data this screen
 * actually holds. The old 收藏 "12" and 行李清單 "0 / 18" were neither counted
 * nor countable, and an invented number on a row that does nothing is the
 * cheapest way to make every real number in the app look invented too.
