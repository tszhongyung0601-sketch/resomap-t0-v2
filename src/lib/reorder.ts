/**
 * Editing one day by hand: move a stop, drop a stop, change a time.
 *
 * Pure functions over `Day`. Nothing here knows about React, and nothing here
 * decides what the traveller meant — the screen decides that. This file only
 * answers "given that happened, what does the day look like now".
 *
 * Two rules run through all of it, and both are borrowed rather than invented.
 *
 * 1. The clock shifts; it is never rebuilt.
 *
 *    lib/adapt.ts's header makes the argument in full: a dinner at 18:30 is at
 *    18:30 because somebody booked a table, and an assistant that recomputes
 *    the day as a running sum of walking times quietly moves it. So a stop the
 *    traveller did not touch keeps its own time, and is pushed later only when
 *    the stop in front of it has made that time physically impossible — by
 *    exactly the number of minutes needed, never more. Nothing is ever pulled
 *    earlier: deleting a stop frees time, it does not drag the afternoon
 *    forward on top of a reservation. That is adapt.ts's `Math.max(original,
 *    original + delay - freed)` rule, restated for an edit the traveller made
 *    themselves.
 *
 * 2. Only the legs that actually changed are re-measured.
 *
 *    Moving one stop changes at most three pairs of neighbours; deleting one
 *    changes exactly one. Every other leg in the day was authored by a person
 *    and sits closer to the street than a straight line does — 神農街 → 赤崁樓
 *    is 620 m in the fixture and 778 m as the crow flies. Re-measuring the
 *    whole day after a delete at the bottom of it would rewrite every distance
 *    above the edit with nothing on screen to explain why, which is the same
 *    failure lib/adapt.ts avoids by re-measuring only the legs either side of a
 *    swapped stop.
 *
 * A leg that IS re-measured is measured the way AddPoi measures a newly added
 * stop: `distance()` from lib/geo.ts, on foot at 75 m/min with a five-minute
 * floor. A stop dragged into a slot and a stop added into the same slot
 * therefore report the same distance between the same two places, which is the
 * whole point — two ways of doing one thing must not disagree about the map.
 */
